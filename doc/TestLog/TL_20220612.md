## Issue

1. `fireEvent` wraps `act()` so don't bother wrapping `fireEvent` with `act(()=>{})`
The problem with the `logoutModal` test to make it disapper can be roughly describe as following
- Since `Portal` is  mocked by `View`, the logic of showing and hiding `Modal` is not simply a state change. I can be told from `snopshot` changes that: 
  - first state change from `visible: false` to `visible: true` mounts `Modal` from nothing
  - following state change from `visible: true` to `visible: false` never unmount `Modal`
- The `TouchableWithoutFeedback` is actually `View` in the tree. `OnPress` actually do work.

Leave it for now.
