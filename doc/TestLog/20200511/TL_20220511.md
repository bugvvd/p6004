## Jest

Jest runs the code in your project as Javascript. When using syntax such as `.tsx` (Typscript + JSX), `.ts` (Typescript) or `.vue` (Vue template) which Node can't process, we need to **transoform** them into plainJjavascript.

`jest.config.js`

preset

setupFile

moduleFileExtensions

transformIgnorePatterns

transform

code transformation:
images:

Importing images is a way to include them in your browser bundle, but they are not valid JavaScript. One way of handling it in Jest is to replace the imported value with its filename.

```js
const path = require("path");
module.exports = {
  process(sourceText, sourcePath, options) {
    return {
      code: `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(path.basename(sourcePath))};`,
    };
  },
};
```



## Issue

#### 1. Jest: React Navigation

It seems hopeless to get rid of propType warning probably from `react-navigation/drawer`. It may just be a typing problem with this particular package.

```shell
Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `source` supplied to `Image`, expected one of type [number]
```

even after I strictly follow the doc,

- [Jest: Testing React Native Apps -> Preset configuration -> transformIgnorePatterns customization](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react-native#transformignorepatterns-customization)
- [Jest: Code Transformation -> TypeScript with type checking](https://jestjs.io/docs/code-transformation#typescript-with-type-checking)
- [React-Native-Testing-Library: React Navigation -> Drawer Navigation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/react-navigation#drawer-navigator)
  > The Stack Navigator example testing executed just fine without warning.

Ergo I leave the warnings on without using [warningSuppressor](https://www.codeisbae.com/react-disable-proptypes-warning/).

#### 2. Jest: Openhandles

when running plain jest test , though all test pass,console shows,

```shell
% yarn test
# or
% jest

Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
```

when tried with `yarn test --detectOpenHandles` it reports something I can't make sense of. Ergo I choose to go `yarn test --watch-all` with and without `--detectOpenHandles`. Both work fine. That Openhandle shit seems like pure shit.

### 3. React Native Testing Library: You called act(async () => ...) without await

[Error thrown - Warning: You called act(async () => ...) without await. #379](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/issues/379)

When testing [example drawer test](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/redux-integration#drawer-navigator),

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import { render, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react-native";

import DrawerAppNavigator from "../src/navigator/DrawerNavigator";

describe("Testing react navigation", () => {
  test("screen contains a button linking to the notifications page", async () => {
    const component = (
      <NavigationContainer>
        <DrawerAppNavigator />
      </NavigationContainer>
    );

    const { findByText, findAllByText } = render(component);
    const button = await findByText("Go to notifications");
    expect(button).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("clicking on the button takes you to the notifications screen", async () => {
    const component = (
      <NavigationContainer>
        <DrawerAppNavigator />
      </NavigationContainer>
    );

    const { queryByText, findByText } = render(component);
    const oldScreen = queryByText("Welcome!");
    const button = await findByText("Go to notifications");

    expect(oldScreen).toBeTruthy();
  });

  test("clicking on the button takes you to the notifications screen", async () => {
    const component = (
      <NavigationContainer>
        <DrawerAppNavigator />
      </NavigationContainer>
    );

    const { queryByText, findByText } = render(component);
    const oldScreen = queryByText("Welcome!");
    const button = await findByText("Go to notifications");

    expect(oldScreen).toBeTruthy();
    fireEvent(button, "press");
    const newScreen = await findByText("This is the notifications screen");

    expect(newScreen).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

upon `openhandlers` warning, this warning came out,

```shell
Warning: You called act(async () => ...) without await. This could lead to unexpected testing behaviour, interleaving multiple act calls and mixing their scopes. You should - await act(async () => ...);
```

But this warning only come out when there are more than 1 `await` within a `it` statement. Some point out it might be a [race problem](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/issues/379#issuecomment-701027921). And the most recent solution suggestion is [here](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library/issues/379#issuecomment-1119590485).
