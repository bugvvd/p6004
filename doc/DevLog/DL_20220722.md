## NestJS

1. Request payloads
But first (if you use TypeScript), we need to determine the DTO (Data Transfer Object) schema. A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network. We could determine the DTO schema by using TypeScript interfaces, or by simple classes. Interestingly, we recommend using classes here. Why? Classes are part of the JavaScript ES6 standard, and therefore they are preserved as real entities in the compiled JavaScript. On the other hand, since TypeScript interfaces are removed during the transpilation, Nest can't refer to them at runtime. This is important because features such as Pipes enable additional possibilities when they have access to the metatype of the variable at runtime.

2. `@Res` in controller

Note that when you inject either @Res() or @Response() in a method handler, you put Nest into Library-specific mode for that handler, and you become responsible for managing the response. When doing so, you must issue some kind of response by making a call on the response object (e.g., res.json(...) or res.send(...)), or the HTTP server will hang.

It essentially makes a controller function untestable.

3. validation pipe

pipes operate on the arguments being processed by a controller route handler.
