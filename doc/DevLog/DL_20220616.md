## React Native

tools:targetApi="30"

pod update 443

## React Native

1. ios simulator
in case live reloading doesn't work. `cmd+d` enable fast refresh

## TypeScript

1. when using string literal as object index
```shell
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type '{[someObject]}'
```
solution:

```js
const someObj:ObjectType = data;
const field = 'username';

// This gives an error
const temp = someObj[field];

// Solution 1: When the type of the object is known
const temp = someObj[field as keyof ObjectType]

// Solution 2: When the type of the object is not known
const temp = someObj[field as keyof typeof someObj]
```
