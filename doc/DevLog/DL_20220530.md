## React Native

### Redux

```shell
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux @types/react-redux
```
not ready but gotta go with `@reduxjs/toolkit`
Redux Toolkit includes the Redux core, as well as other key packages we feel are essential for building Redux applications (such as Redux Thunk and Reselect). 

less code, works better with thunk(?), and ts (?)

`createSlice`
It also automatically generates **action creator functions for each reducer**, and generates action type strings internally based on your reducer's names. Finally, it works great with TypeScript.

Define Typed Hooks


### `@reduxjs/toolkit`

### Async and data fetching
A Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

#### thunk

The word "thunk" is a programming term that means "a piece of code that does some delayed work". Rather than execute some logic now, we can write a function body or code that can be used to perform the work later. For redux,  "thunks" are a pattern of writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's `dispatch` and `getState` methods.

Thunks are typically written in "slice" files. createSlice itself does not have any special support for defining thunks, so you should write them as separate functions in the same slice file. 

## Typescript

### Typescript && RTK

Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the standard approach for writing modern Redux logic. RTK is already written in TypeScript, and its API is designed to provide a good experience for TypeScript usage.
